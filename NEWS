Version 1.3.2
  Wrote a longer description line for the package, to more fully describe what the package does.
  Hat Tip: Uwe Liggs
  
Version 1.3.1
  parallel processing now removed from ensemble examples to pass CRAN check
  Namespace Imports from stats package implemented  
  Hat Tip for all of these: Kurt Hornik
  Also cleaned up main package documentation file
  
Version 1.3
  Belief Builder functions' options are now implemented as a parameter list
  Documentation updated to reflect this change
  A proper Ensemble function has finally been written
  Parallel processing fixed in the ensemble function
  Ensemble function now has a function to return all the classification matrices in order
  Package now depends on 'parallel' package

Version 1.2
  Added Full namespace export directive
  Removed dependency on cepp
    -Added files bases.R (Contains 3 functions from the tourr package by Hadley Wickham)
    -Added original documentation file for basis_random
  Reorganized files 
    -combination functions moved to file combine.R
    -documentation moved to combine.Rd
  Added a verbose option to bpa and bpamat print objects
  Rewrote combine.ds function
    
Version 1.1
  Is a Major Upgrade from before, primarily in terms of architecture
  get.NN 
    Can now return the largest distance it finds (This feature used in the jitter belief function)
    Conversion from p to k now automatically handled inside get.NN function
    Functions least.p and which.least.p still retained in file knn_header.R
    Documentation Updated to include examples of new feature
  bpa
    Now declared as a class, with print method & Documentation Updated
  bpa.mat
    Now declared as a class, with print method & Documentation Updated. Example Added.
  Removed file DS_Classify.R, replaced with Belief.R
  New Belief Functions documented
  Documentation file for proj_classify removed
  File Ensemble.R removed (temporarily)
  Documentation file ensemble.Rd removed (temporarily)
  
Version 1.0
  Combination function was coded wrong, retain, but code new DS function
    Done & Verified for bpa objects
    Done & Verified for bpamat objects
  Rewrite assigned ratios function so that it always returns ratios to ignorance
  
Version 0.9
  Fix bug in get.NN function - distances were being returned wrong  
  Add more belief functions (New File: Belief.R)
  
Version 0.8
  Revert proj_classify to that in package version 0.5
  Remove 'info' argument from proj_classify
  Update proj_classify documentation
  Fix bug in ensemble function where nmats was not being updated
  Update ensemble function to work with the new proj_classify function
  Document the ensemble function
  
Version 0.7
  Including an ensemble function
  Fixed a bug in the bpamat combine function
  
Version 0.6
  proj_classify now returns bpa.mat type objects
  Documentation of proj_classify and bpa.mat updated to reflect this change
  
Version 0.5
  proj_classify now accounts for ignorance in classification
  proj_classify now has a field for info
  Fixed a bug in proj_classify where the row names were being assigned wrong
  
Version 0.4
  A new R file is added: DS_Support.R 
    Allows storing multiple bpa objects as matrices
    Meant to better support DS operations in classification
  bpa objects now have two additional fields - name and info
  bpa objects now return full classification info
  Relevant Documentation is added / updated
  
Version 0.3
  Package compiles without error or warnings
  proj_classify now has a working example
  Breast Cancer data is now documented
  
Version 0.2
  UCI Breast Cancer dataset is now part of the package
  bpa objects now return classification information
  bpa lists can be combined at once
  proj_classify is now properly documented
  
Version 0.1
  First Package Version
